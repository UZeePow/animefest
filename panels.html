          <h2 class = "subheader">Panel Descriptions</h2>
              <p class="lead2">Otaku and You: The Weeaboo Experience by Jericho Cabanayan</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 11am- 12pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> What does the otaku culture entail? What it mean to be an otaku? How does being an otaku affect social spheres and other spheres of life? In this exciting panel, we join Jericho Cabanayan, 5-time Waifu Warrior champion and legendary husbando of Cal Animage Beta, on a spiritual journey about otakuism and the social connotations "otaku" bring to the table. Featuring special guests: anime spoilers and Jericho's best waifus. </p>

              <p class="lead2">Pow, Punch, Pika & Chu: The Structure of Sound Effects in Genres of American Comics and Japanese Manga by Nimish K. Pratha</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 12pm - 12:30pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> Recently published research discussing the content and presentation of sound effects in genres of American comics and Japanese manga has revealed deep, profound differences that tie back into the thematic content and archetypes of these genres and cultures themselves. I will be presenting published research I myself have conducted that breaks down these differences. I will also cover how exactly the data-driven, scientific study of comics and manga is conducted.</p>

              <p class="lead2">Form and Meaning: An Introduction to Translation Theory in the Context of Manga Translation by Nimish K. Pratha</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 12:30pm - 1:00pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> As consumers of Japanese media, we all benefit from the fruits of some translator's labor to enjoy the media we do. Sadly, the process of translation is often overshadowed by the translated product, and translation theory itself is little understood. As a veteran translator for the scanlation group MangaStream (the biggest English scanlation group in existence) and a professional freelance translator, I will be discussing the art of translation in the context of Japanese-language manga. Japanese as a language presents several unique challenges to the translator, and the medium of manga is typified by phrasing and structure uncommonly found elsewhere. If you have even a passing interest in learning how the English you read or hear in manga and anime is chosen, come out and listen.</p>

              <p class="lead2">Figure Collecting 101 by Jesus Guerra Fematt Jr</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 1pm - 2pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> An introduction to the world of figure collecting, we'll go through the basics of what goes into starting your collection. Topics will include the various classifications of figures, the best ways to obtain figures, how to avoid bootlegs and many more. We'll be giving an overview of the main figure maker companies and give insight on their popular lines, their strengths, and their weaknesses. So if you've ever been interested in collecting figures of any kind and weren't sure how to start, this panel is for you. </p>

              <p class="lead2">How to Survive Anime Expo and the Zombie Apocalypse by frosty</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 2pm - 3pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> For convention-goers and zombie killers of all experience levels and ages. This panel will teach you how to survive the harsh realities of the coming apocalypse, whether it be bracing against the never-ending sea of weeb trash or the endless nightmare that is the living dead - or you know, both. Remember folks, always double tap, because she might be a trap. </p>

              <p class="lead2">Henshin! An Early Guide to Tokusatsu by Brandon Nguyen</p>
              <p class="desc2"> 3pm - 4pm</p>
              <p class="desc"> Henshin, commonly translated as "transform", is the stock phrase of many costumed Japanese superheroes. The genre they inhabit, tokusatsu or "special effects", encompasses everything from Godzilla to masked motorcycle riders to teams of rangers who are quite powerful indeed. Come learn about the storied past (and colorful present) of this popular genre of Japanese live-action media, and a bit about what it all has to do with anime. This will be an introduction to the genre, with a focus on Kamen Rider and Super Sentai shows. "Now with an additional Sentai surprise!" </p>
