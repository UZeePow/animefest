                    <h4>12 p.m. - Marshall College Room</h4>
                    <p>
                    You've probably seen or read a lot of "shonen" series, such as that one about everyone's favorite ninja Naruto. Ever noticed how they all seem to share some of the same themes? Friendship and rivalry, family and teamwork, or everyone having unique powers. If you are interested in taking a look at shonen series with a more discerning eye, come to my discussion of the genre through the lens of one of the "Big Three" shonen series in recent memory: Naruto. Also come if you have no idea what shonen is, we'll go over that too.

                    Storytelling has been around for ages, bringing entertainment for people generation after generation. Various mediums have been used, but anime is one of the most prevalent modes of storytelling today. So this time around, I will be discussing popular anime cliches and character personalities. We will look at examples such as "accidental perversion" and "love bubbles." We will learn about tsunderes, yanderes, and the legendary thugdere. This will be an exciting workshop, complete with an opportunity to write our own stories with the tropes we learned from the panel.
